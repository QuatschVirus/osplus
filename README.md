# osplus
A python package for additional, simple features like easy config files, logging, and notefications (full only)
NOTE: Since i'm too dumb to upload this to PyPi to make it installable via pip, i'm happy about any offering of help. 😁 I already created a setup.py file, since i found advice that was sort of understandable, but i will provide a guide on how to install it manually.
